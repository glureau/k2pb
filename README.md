# K2PB (Kotlin to ProtoBuf)

(WIP)

Using KSP to generate protobuf from @Serializable kotlin classes.

### Comparison with KotlinX Serialization ProtoBufSchemaGenerator

This tool is another approach to KotlinX solution, some notable differences:

- Serialization works at run time, K2PB works at compile time.
- At run time, Serialization COULD know the serializerModule and @Contextual custom serializer, K2PB don't know them (so
  you'll need to add an annotation to help the generation)
- Serialization has some limitations right now:
    - sealed class are not supported, expecting a oneOf
      translation ([KotlinX Serialization doesn't support it](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/issues/67),
      so schema is coherent with the serialization)
    - custom serializer and @Contextual are not supported (the generator should ask for a ProtoBuf instance to know
      those)
    - value class are not supported (creating useless message, not matching the encoded format)
    - nested classes are not supported
- At compile time, K2PB has access to documentation and more code information to be able to copy those in generated
  protobuf files

(Eventually I hope to be able to handle upgrades from existing protobuf files, that's also another reason to get this
out of KotlinXSerialization/run-time limitations.)

### Status

This is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS, consider it an experimental tool, and don't hesitate to create issues.

Current known limitations / things I'd like to achieve:

- all protobuf annotations are not supported yet (@ProtoNumber, @ProtoXxx)
- object serialization is not supported yet
  encode/decode from Kotlin and from generated Kotlin classes, to compare results)
- proto2 is not supported
- Support reserved fields (dedicated annotation? Real usage?)
- Support upgrading proto files (checking that the newly generated files are compatible with the current ones)
- multi-module support

## Testing

Tests are located in the 2 samples modules. It's asserting that protobuf files are stable.

It's also using protoc on the generated protobuf files, allowing us to test that a message encoded via
KotlinX Serialization will be decoded successfully by the code generated by the protobuf files.

## Proto2/3

Proto2 is not supported at the moment (please open an issue/PR if you need it).
KotlinX Serialization support the Proto3 format IF all **List<>** are annotated with @ProtoPacked.
